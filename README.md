#### Work has just started!

Heres whats planned to go in:

- [VRM the portable avatar specification](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2019-siggraph-asia/VRM-Extending-glTF-for-Portable-Humanoid-Avatars_SIGGRAPH-Asia_Nov19.pdf "glTF VRM") that extends the glTF format. It looks like the best way to incorporate it is [godot-vrm](https://github.com/V-Sekai/godot-vrm "godot-vrm") by V-Sekai.
- glTF-based portable world files that can be loaded at runtime by pre-packing them as godot PCK files. This should mean worlds download when you connect to a new host.
- Portals that act like hyperlinks taking you to other hosts and specific rooms on those hosts.
- VoIP (that wont leak your IP address?)
- Oculus Quest, SteamVR, Windows Mixed Reality support with body with their respective ranges of body tracking impacting your avatar.
- Addon system, also using godot pre-packed assets, for such colloboration features like virtual laptops you can screen share to, presentation loaders, jumbo whiteboards etc.

#### More information to shortly follow..
